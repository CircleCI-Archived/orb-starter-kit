# Orb Starter Kit

This orb starter kit will help you write your own orbs.

Orbs are reusable commands, executors, and jobs—snippets of CircleCI configuration—that can be shared across teams and projects. See [CircleCI Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs), [Explore Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry), [Creating Orbs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/creating-orbs), and [Using Orbs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/using-orbs) for further information.

## Usage

### notes for me

bunch of jobs:

1. basic lint & validate
2. some kind of inline thing like in build-tools or hello-orb
3. bats testing (via a bats test orb, either its own or thru orb-tools)
4. automated deploy-to-dev
4. manual-approval promote to prod
