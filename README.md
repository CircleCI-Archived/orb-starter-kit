# Orb Starter Kit

This orb starter kit will help you write your own orbs.

Orbs are reusable [commands](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#authoring-reusable-commands), [executors](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#authoring-reusable-executors), and [jobs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#jobs-defined-in-an-orb), as well as [usage examples](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/config-preview-sdk/blob/v2.1/docs/usage-examples.md)—snippets of CircleCI configuration—that can be shared across teams and projects. See [CircleCI Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs), [Explore Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry), [Creating Orbs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/creating-orbs), and [Using Orbs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/using-orbs) for further information.
